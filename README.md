**Apollo Save Tool** is an application to manage save-game files, trophies, and licenses on the PlayStation 3.

The `apollo-ps3` homebrew app allows to download, unlock, patch and resign save-game files directly on your PS3. It can also unlock and resign trophies, backup/restore licenses, and create PS2 Classic images.

# Usage

Using the application is simple and straight-forward: 

 - Move <kbd>UP</kbd>/<kbd>DOWN</kbd> to select the save-game file you want to patch, and press ![X button](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/CROSS.png). The patch screen will show the available fixes for the file. Select the patches and click `Apply`.
 - To view the item's details, press ![Triangle](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/TRIANGLE.png).
It will open the context menu on the screen. Press ![O button](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/CIRCLE.png) to return to the list.
 - To reload the list, press ![Square](https://github.com/bucanero/pkgi-ps3/raw/master/data/SQUARE.png).
 - Press <kbd>L1</kbd>/<kbd>L2</kbd> or <kbd>R1</kbd>/<kbd>R2</kbd> trigger buttons to move pages up or down.

## Overriding auto-detected settings

If you want to override the auto-detected IDs used by Apollo to resign the save-games, you can use the `owners.xml` file.
For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<apollo version="1.2.0">
  <owner name="PS3 User">
    <console idps="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 0123456789ABCDEF" psid="FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 0123456789ABCDEF"/>
    <user id="00000002" account_id="0123456789abcdef"/>
  </owner>
  <owner name="Other User">
    <console idps="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 0123456789ABCDEF" psid="FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 0123456789ABCDEF"/>
    <user id="00000008" account_id="abcdef0123456789"/>
  </owner>
</apollo>
```

The file must be saved on `/dev_hdd0/game/NP0APOLLO/USRDIR/owners.xml`. Apollo will load the hard-coded values when launched, and you should 
select the desired Owner from the **Settings** menu.

In the `owners.xml` you need to define:
- Owner name
- User ID (e.g.: `00000123`)
- Account ID (e.g.: `0123456789abcdef`)
- Console PSID (e.g.: `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 0123456789ABCDEF`)
- Console IDPS (required for license import/export)

# Online Database

The application also provides direct access to the [Apollo online database](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-saves) of save-game files for PlayStation 3 games. These usually offer additional features such as completed games that can save you many hours of playing.

Currently, the list of available games and files is limited, but the project aims to add more save-games shared by the community.

**Note:** Downloaded save files **must be resigned** using Apollo before loading them in your games.

# FAQs

 1. Where I can get a save-game for *XYZ game*?
    
    You can check sites like [Brewology.com](https://ps3.brewology.com/gamesaves/savedgames.php?page=savedgames&system=ps3), and [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps3/). Also, searching on [Google](http://www.google.com) might help.
 1. I have a save-game file that I want to share. How can I upload it?
    
    If you have a save file that is not currently available on the Online Database and want to share it, please check [this link](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-saves) for instructions.
 1. Why is it called **Apollo**?
    
    [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo) was the twin brother of [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis), goddess of the hunt. Since this project was born using the [Artemis-GUI](https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/ArtemisPS3/) codebase, I decided to respect that heritage by calling it Apollo.

# Building

You need to have installed:

- [PS3 toolchain](https://github.com/bucanero/ps3toolchain)
- [PSL1GHT](https://github.com/ps3dev/PSL1GHT) SDK
- [Tiny3D](https://github.com/wargio/Tiny3D) library
- [polarSSL](https://github.com/bucanero/ps3libraries/blob/master/scripts/015-polarssl-1.3.9.sh) library
- [dbglogger](https://github.com/bucanero/psl1ght-libs/tree/master/dbglogger) library (only required for debug logging)

Run `make` to create a release build. If you want to include the latest save patches in your `.pkg` file, run `make createzip`.
Finally, run `make pkg` to create a `.pkg` install file.

You can also set the `PS3LOAD` environment variable to the PS3 IP address: `export PS3LOAD=tcp:x.x.x.x`.
This will allow you to use `make run` and send `apollo-ps3.self` directly to the [PS3Load listener](https://github.com/bucanero/ps3loadx).

To enable debug logging, build Apollo Save Tool with `make DEBUGLOG=1`. The application will send debug messages to
UDP multicast address `239.255.0.100:30000`. To receive them you can use [socat][] on your computer:

    $ socat udp4-recv:30000,ip-add-membership=239.255.0.100:0.0.0.0 -
